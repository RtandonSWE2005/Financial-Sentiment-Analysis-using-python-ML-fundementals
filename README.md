ðŸ“Š Financial Sentiment Analyzer (Python, ML + FinBERT)

This project is a Financial Text Sentiment Analyzer built in Python, combining traditional ML models (TF-IDF + Logistic Regression, SVM, Naive Bayes) with state-of-the-art NLP (FinBERT).
It also performs stock correlation analysis, linking sentiment in financial headlines to real market returns.
